### Design Approach 1: Data-Driven Minimalism
**Design Movement**: Swiss Design / Information Architecture

- Neutral color palette with strategic accent colors

**Color Philosophy:**
- Primary: Cool grays (#F5F5F5 backgrounds, #2C3E50 text)
- Accent: Teal (#0D9488) for interactive elements and key metrics
- Supporting: Soft blues (#E0F2FE) for secondary information
- Rationale: Professional, trustworthy, focuses attention on data

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Asymmetric grid with left-aligned content
- Sidebar navigation with sticky positioning
- Full-width data visualization sections
- Modular card system for metrics and insights

**Signature Elements:**
1. Minimalist line charts with gradient fills
2. Circular progress indicators for feasibility scores
3. Comparison tables with alternating row backgrounds

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Smooth scroll-triggered animations for section reveals
- Hover states that highlight data points
- Interactive toggles for scenario comparisons
- Subtle transitions between sections

**Animation:**
- Fade-in animations for content on scroll (200ms duration)
- Number counter animations for metrics (1000ms duration)
- Smooth transitions on hover (150ms ease-out)
- Staggered entrance for list items (100ms delay between items)

**Typography System:**
- Display: Poppins Bold (36px) for main headings
- Body: Inter Regular (16px) for content
- Data: IBM Plex Mono (12px) for technical information
